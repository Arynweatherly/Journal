I created a help command and also learned how to use the tree command. We then started working with CSS style sheets and linked it to our HTML sheet to change the color of our website we were working on. The final practice exercise was a bit of a challenge for me at first but i figured it out eventually.",

We worked on the second part of making our journal which seemed a bit confusing at first but after asking mo about it, everything was cleared up. I felt pretty perplexed today in all honesty. I got to school late so i felt behind, but i stayed later and worked on some of the assignments. I also took lots of notes toward the end of the day which did help a bit.",
